Hi, my name is gamme and this is my friend TIMTOM.  TIMTOM is written in mSL, the mIRC Scripting Language.  In order to use TIMTOM, you first must download mIRC: www.mirc.com

Now would like TIMTOM to serve you?  I'm sure you would.  First, connect to your favorite IRC server under the nick TIMTOM.  If TIMTOM is already taken choose something similar.  Now, on your mIRC tabs, click on Tools:Scripts Editor:Remote and copy the contents of TIMTOM into Remote.  That's it!  Now TIMTOM can serve you and your friends in your favorite channel!
